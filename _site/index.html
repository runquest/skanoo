        <p>It is time to celebrate love with cake.

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I'll take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe and bake from the heart..

(Sara Bareilles, What's inside)

        <p>Soft and fluffy sponge cake with the taste of sweet honey laced throughout.

It only takes a taste
When it’s something special
It only takes a taste
When ya know it’s good
Sometimes one bite is more than enough
To know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of...

(It only takes a taste, Sara Bareilles)

The honey is baked right into the cake.  Prepared and heated with creamy butter, cinnamon and lemon zest combine all the ingredients in perfect medley. The simple sour cream frosting with a hint of lemon tartness keeps the cake layers soft and juicy.  Garnished with fresh fruit that adds vibrant colours to this cinnamon-hued cake and balances the sweet and tart.

The Honey Cake will be one of the moistest cakes your taste buds will ever try!</p>

      <img src="./zaneta-about.jpg">
      <p>Welcome to my bakery! I’m Zaneta.
As you are reading this I am whipping another cake for you to try.

I live and bake in Ottawa, Ontario. However my love travels all across Canada to Vancouver on regular basis to remind my kids of home. It’s my biggest joy to share my love with family, friends and hopefully you through my baking.

Skanoo (Skanu (lithuanian)) means tasty, delicious, extraordinarily feel good flavor.

My intention is to make sure that every creation that leaves my kitchen would taste and feel like a bite of heaven just landed on to earth.</p>
